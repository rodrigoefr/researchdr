Parameters of Clustering Execution for SM Students

-K-Means: 
n_clusters ranging from 2 to 6

-Affinity propagation: 
damping ranging from 0.5 to 0.95 
affinity = 'euclidean' 

-Mean-shift: 
bandwidth with variation of a number generated by the estimate_bandwidth function, which receives as a parameter the input Dataset and the quantile value ranging from 0.01 to 0.99

-Agglomerative clustering: 
n_clusters ranging from 2 to 6 
affinity = 'euclidean'

-DBSCAN: 
eps ranging from 0.0001 to 74.5001 
min_samples with values 10, 50 and 100 

-OPTICS: 
min_samples with values 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 20, 35 and 40 
metric with values 'cityblock', 'cosine', 'euclidean', 'l1', 'l2', 'manhattan' and 'minkowski' 

-Gaussian mixtures: 
n_components ranging from 2 to 6 

-BIRCH: 
n_clusters ranging from 2 to 6 

-Bisecting K-Means: 
n_clusters ranging from 2 to 6
